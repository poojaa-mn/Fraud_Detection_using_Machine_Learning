#Fraud Detection using Machine Learning
</br>The main objective of Fraud Detection using Machine Learning is to use various predictive models to see how accurate they are in detecting whether a transaction is a normal payment or a fraud.
</br>The steps involved in the project are:
</br>
#1. Read and understand the data
</br>#2. Exploratory Analysis.
</br>#3. Normalization of data
</br>#4. Visualization of correlations
</br>#5. Model Architecture-(Logistic Regression,SupportVectorClassifier,KNeighborsClassifier,Random Forest Classifier',DecisionTreeClassifier)
</br>#6. Model Evaluation and Prediction</br>
#Conclusion:The highest accuracy is obtained by using Logistic Regression(91.3%).
