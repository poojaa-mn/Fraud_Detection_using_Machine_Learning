<b>Fraud Detection using Machine Learning</b>
</br>The main objective of Fraud Detection using Machine Learning is to use various predictive models to see how accurate they are in detecting whether a transaction is a normal payment or a fraud.
</br>The steps involved in the project are:
</br>
1.Read and understand the data</br>2. Exploratory Analysis.</br>3. Normalization of data</br>4. Visualization of correlations</br>5. Model Architecture-(Logistic Regression,SupportVectorClassifier,KNeighborsClassifier,Random Forest Classifier,DecisionTreeClassifier)</br>6. Model Evaluation and Prediction</br><b>Conclusion:</b>The highest accuracy is obtained by using Logistic Regression(91.3%).
